# Box Sample
This sample is a simple C++ program that takes console input (box dimensions) and computes their sum (box volume).

We use this example in our blog posts to illustrate new extension features.

## Build and Debug Active File
Available as of March 2019, "Build and Debug Active File" automatically configures the build tasks and kicks off a build and debug session.

### Context Menu
While editing a file in a workspace folder, you can right click in the editor field and select the "Build and Debug Active File" context menu option.

![right click and select Build and Debug Active File](./Code Samples\BoxConsoleSample\build_debug_active_file.png)

Your tasks.json and launch.json files will be created and the project will build and launch the debugger mode.

### Command
Another way to begin building and debugging your active file is to execute the command by pressing "F5".

Just like with the context menu, your tasks.json and launch.json files will be created and the project will build and launch the debugger mode.
